# Thesis
thesis in computer science Master degree,

The aim is to test diffusion generative models against membership inference attacks.

I have studied diffusion models and how to attack them in a scarce resource environments.
The attack is reproducible at home using google colab, for the attack to be possible a very small part of the dataset must be disclosed.
I have reproduced the main attack MIA from state-of-the-art papers and I have also created and modified other MIAs.
If you are curious to understand more take a look at my thesis pdf in the repo (work in progres...) or take a look at the code!
